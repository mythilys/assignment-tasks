1.Import csv files into a table using pgAdmin ?

Step 1: To create a csv file either with excel or notepad in csv format,
with the columns and row data filled in it.

Step 2: To create a table specifying the column and row name alone without 
entering the values.

Step 3: Open the Pg admin and right click on to the table name. 
We could find a option of import and export click on it.

Step 4: Now paste the path of the csv file and press import and 
set the header as yes and select the delimiter as ",".

Step 5: Then press ok and thus you could export the data to the table from 
the csv file.

ON table-name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ];

Cascade which means it will drop all the objects related with the trigger

Restrict which means it will note delete the trigger if objects
are depended 	

3.Add an auto incremented primary key to an existing table add 
an foreign key to an existing table ?

For auto increment of the primary key to an existing table

COMMAND:

ADD column id serial NOT NULL Primary Key;

We have to indicate the type of the id as SERIAL.
So automatically the primary key will get incremented.
